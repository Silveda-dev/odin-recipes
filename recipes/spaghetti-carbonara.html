    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti carbonara is a traditional Italian pasta dish with a creamy, cheesy sauce topped with pancetta and pepper. It's also one of my favourite dishes - it's a birthday tradition to make some each year.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is a simple recipe (from BBC GoodFood) to make your own traditional carbonara that still tastes delicious!</p>

        <li>350g spaghetti</li>
